            As the decades move on, the number of video games produced also
            increases. The sudden dip in the 2010s decade has to do with the
            fact that the dataset used only contains video games up to 2016. The
            real value for the decade should be near or above the 2000s decade.

            Interestingly enough, the average global earnings seem to be
            decreasing by decade. This could be because not all video games
            perform well, especially considering the increasing amount of video
            games produced per decade.

            Keep in mind that the dataset used is not completely all-inclusive.
            The dataset does not include the mobile platform, and a majority of
            the video games listed follow a buy-to-play business model. Some
            highest-grossing video games like Dungeon Fighter Online (2005) are
            not included as it is free-to-play.

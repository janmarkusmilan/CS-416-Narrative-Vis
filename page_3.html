            When viewing video game data strictly through genre, we can see that
            the crowd favorite is the Action genre, with the highest video game
            count of 3,252 and the highest global earnings with a total of
            $1,722,870,000.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Most of the bars follow a relation where a high game count results
            in high total global earnings, and vice versa. One of the outliers
            is the Adventure genre with a high game count of 1,276 and a low
            total global earning of $234,800,000, one of the lowest total global
            earnings on this chart. Another would be the Misc genre with a high
            game count of 1,710 and a relatively low global earning of
            $797,620,000.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The top three genres based on total global earnings are Action
            ($1.7B), Sports ($1.3B), and Shooter ($1B) in that order. The lowest
            three genres are Strategy ($173M), Adventure ($234M), and Puzzle
            ($242M) in that order.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The top three genres based on game count are Action (3,252), Sports
            (2,304), and Misc (1,710) in that order. The lowest three genres are
            Puzzle (571), Strategy (671), and Fighting (836) in that order.

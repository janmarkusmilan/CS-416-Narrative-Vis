        <p>Based on all the observations we made, what can we conclude?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The database used isn't entirely all-inclusive and only contains
            video game data up to 2016. Moreover, a majority of the video games
            in the dataset operate under a pay-to-play model, so games that are
            essentially free-to-play but have paid optional content (skins,
            battlepasses, gacha, etc.) are not included. Due to these
            constraints, the results may appear biased, skewed, or incomplete.

            Since the 1980s, overall video game production and global earnings
            have exponentially increased. This can be due to greater
            technological development, an increase in entertainment development
            to fulfill spiritual needs, and more. A majority of global earnings
            also come from North America, with the EU in second place.

            The Action genre seems to be the go-to for making a video game, as
            it has the highest video game count and highest global earnings. Old
            consoles are also gradually abandoned by the times in favor of more
            recent tech such as the Playstation and Xbox, as indicated by their
            earnings and video game count.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What do you think? Are these results accurate or skewed by the
          available data?

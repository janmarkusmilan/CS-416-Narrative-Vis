            Global video game sales remained relatively calm until 1996, where
            sales broke through the $100M mark and even the $200M mark the
            following year. This matches the data found in the previous graph,
            as not only do the amount of video games increase by the decade, but
            also the technology used for making the games.
          </li>

          <li>
            From 1996, yearly video game global sales continue to gradually
            increase until hitting a peak in 2008, earning a total of
            $678,900,000 that year. Following that, the yearly global earnings
            start to decline, hitting a bottom in 2016 with only $70,930,000
            earned (partly due to the fact that the dataset isn't too populated
            with games from 2016 and beyond).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            This data matches the findings in the previous slide, with total
            earnings staying relatively calm in the 1980s, slowly ramping up in
            the 1990s, hitting a peak in the 2000s, and slowly declining in the
            2010s.
